    <p><a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/dachshund#/slide/1" target="_blank">Dauchshunds</a> are known to be very friendly and good with children. Not only that, but they are somewhat easy to train. But, don't let their cute little faces fool you, this breed is as fiesty as it is cute. 
        With loud piercing barks and big personaility in  their tiny bodies, they no doubt will be a handful that refuses to be ignored. They are a breed of hound dogs they were bred to hunt badgers
        and other tunneling animals hence their tiny and long bodies. They are able to fit in those tiny holes and get the desired animal. So, of course with a purpose like that they can be a handful.
         They are very intelligent but also incredibly stubborn dogs, which can make a bit difficult at times. But positive, reward based training has proven to be effective. For more information click the link below! </p>
